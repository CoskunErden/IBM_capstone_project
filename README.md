# SpaceX Falcon 9 Launch Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves web scraping, data wrangling, and analysis of SpaceX Falcon 9 launch records. The main objective is to extract data about SpaceX's launches from a Wikipedia page, process it, and save the data in a structured format (CSV). The data includes launch site, payload, payload mass, orbit, customer, booster version, launch outcome, and whether the booster landed successfully.

The final dataset is used to gain insights into the launches and their outcomes, which can be further analyzed using machine learning or other data analysis techniques.

## Project Components

The project is divided into several tasks, including:
1. **Web Scraping**: Using Python libraries such as `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` to extract Falcon 9 launch data from a Wikipedia page.
2. **Data Parsing**: Processing the scraped data to extract the relevant information for each launch.
3. **Data Wrangling**: Cleaning and formatting the extracted data into a structured format.
4. **Data Saving**: Storing the processed data in a CSV file for further analysis.

## Project Structure

```
├── spacex_web_scraped.csv          # Output CSV file with launch data
├── Web_Scraping.ipynb              # Jupyter notebook performing web scraping and data extraction
├── README.md                       # Project description and documentation
├── requirements.txt                # Python dependencies
└── spacex_dash_app.py              # Dash app for visualizing the SpaceX launches (if applicable)
```

### Key Files:
- **Web_Scraping.ipynb**: Contains the Python code that scrapes the Wikipedia page, parses the launch data, and saves it in CSV format.
- **spacex_web_scraped.csv**: The final output CSV file containing the extracted data.
- **requirements.txt**: List of required Python packages such as `pandas`, `beautifulsoup4`, and `requests`.

## Dependencies

Before running the project, ensure you have the following Python packages installed. You can install them using the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required Libraries:
- `pandas`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `requests`
- `unicodedata` (built-in)
- `re` (built-in)

## Data Sources

The data is scraped from the **[List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falcon_9_and_Falcon_Heavy_launches)** page on Wikipedia. The data includes information about the flight number, launch site, payload, orbit, customer, booster version, and the outcome of each launch.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CoskunErden/IBM_capstone_project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**:
   ```bash
   cd IBM_capstone_project
   ```

3. **Run the Web Scraping Notebook**:
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Web_Scraping.ipynb`) in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook and run all cells to scrape the data and save it to `spacex_web_scraped.csv`.

4. **Inspect the CSV File**:
   - After running the notebook, inspect the `spacex_web_scraped.csv` file in the same directory. It will contain the structured launch data.

## Data Columns

The final CSV file contains the following columns:

- **Flight No.**: The flight number of the launch.
- **Launch site**: The site where the launch occurred.
- **Payload**: The payload being delivered.
- **Payload mass**: The mass of the payload.
- **Orbit**: The target orbit for the payload.
- **Customer**: The customer who paid for the launch.
- **Launch outcome**: Whether the launch was successful.
- **Version Booster**: The version of the booster used in the launch.
- **Booster landing**: Whether the booster landed successfully.
- **Date**: The launch date.
- **Time**: The launch time.

## Potential Future Work

- **Data Analysis**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends in the launches.
- **Machine Learning**: Use machine learning to predict launch outcomes or other interesting insights.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the launch data using tools like `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, or `plotly`.
- **Dash App**: Create an interactive dashboard using `Dash` or `Streamlit` to visualize the Falcon 9 launch data.
